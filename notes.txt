//Are you absolutly sure you need to modify this file. Check again.

// Also which html file does it belong in if any? If it doesn't belong in an HTML or any of the other files, how is it initialized, called or used? What is it's purpose? Please, verify, ensure that this file is updated to use ES Modals and dont use the weird notations. ensure that all variables, functions, and wording are consistent across files and that everything links properly.

//We should only need to collect the submissions (entries) so it connects to the  organizer so when the organizer clicks a breed from within linuep.html, it iterates over the submissions saved by the exhibitor from the exhibitor.html, and sends an pusher notifications sound (root/sounds/alert.mp3) to the exhibitor where the submissions matches the breed within the exhibitors lineups. When the organizer clicks a breed on lineup.html, your code should iterate over the joined lineups/submissions, lineup.html's lineups and exhibitor.html's submissions, that match on category, show, and breeeds. Those submissions come from the 'submission's table (which has columns is, category_id, show_id, and breed_id) that you join with the  (organizer-created) lineups data. The "lineups" table has columns id, show_id, category_id, breed_id.There is also an 'exhibitors' table that has columns/id, name, submissions. There is a table 'organizers' with columns/id (1), show_name(Show A), and lineup([{"show":"Show A","breeds":[{"Holland Lop"], "category": "Open"}]etc.

based on the submissions array i gave and all of the tables and their structures ive shared previously in this thread, does this file line up with our most current changes and whats needed to function with the data tables and other code?
