//Are you absolutly sure you need to modify this file. Check again.

// Also which html file does it belong in if any? If it doesn't belong in an HTML or any of the other files, how is it initialized, called or used? What is it's purpose? Please, verify, ensure that this file is updated to use ES Modals and dont use the weird notations. ensure that all variables, functions, and wording are consistent across files and that everything links properly.

//We should only need to collect the submissions (entries) so it connects to the  organizer so when the organizer clicks a breed from within linuep.html, it iterates over the submissions saved by the exhibitor from the exhibitor.html, and sends an pusher notifications sound (root/sounds/alert.mp3) to the exhibitor where the submissions matches the breed within the exhibitors lineups. When the organizer clicks a breed on lineup.html, your code should iterate over the joined lineups/submissions, lineup.html's lineups and exhibitor.html's submissions, that match on category, show, and breeeds. Those submissions come from the 'submission's table (which has columns is, category_id, show_id, and breed_id) that you join with the  (organizer-created) lineups data. The "lineups" table has columns id, show_id, category_id, breed_id.There is also an 'exhibitors' table that has columns/id, name, submissions. There is a table 'organizers' with columns/id (1), show_name(Show A), and lineup([{"show":"Show A","breeds":[{"Holland Lop"], "category": "Open"}]etc.

based on the submissions array i gave and all of the tables and their structures ive shared previously in this thread, does this file line up with our most current changes and whats needed to function with the data tables and other code?

on the organizers side .. the lineup.html is ONLY displaying the hard coded example in the js somewhere. it is NOT displaying the save lineups. listen closely so you know where to find your error. before our changes today the organizer side worked PERFECTLY. plz find the error. AND the way the lineups are being displayd on the lineup.html page is WRONG. it should be display this way...

<h2>"Lineup" :<br> indent A (which is show: 1)<br> <h2>"Category":<br> indent Youth<br> <h2>"Breed":<br> indent REX<BR> MINI LOP<BR> RHINELANDER<BR> HARLEQUIN<BR> etc

*and with a checkbox to the left of the breed but not touching the breed name. this box is the box the organizer will click to send the pusher notification to the exhibitor while in the lineup.html page. none of the type should be blue. all black. create all this using bootstrap in the js.

Client:

Sends breed_ids as an array (plural) in the JSON payload.

Server:

Validates that breed_ids is a non-empty array.

Iterates over each element in breed_ids and inserts it into the lineups table under the breed_id column.

Database:

The lineups table uses a singular column, breed_id, to store one breed ID per row.

The actual breed details (including breed_name) are stored in the breeds table, which can be joined later as needed.
